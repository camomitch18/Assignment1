    <h1>Project Idea: Sign Language Video Game</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The project idea that I have come up with is a video game designed to teach and test users different levels of Australian Sign Language, or Auslan. This can be done through a stage-based game, with different levels of difficulty as the user progresses through the game. Using a camera to motion track the users' movements, the game can use a grading system for the accuracy of the users' sign language skills. Not solely focused on learning sign language, users can customise their character, and earn rewards as they progress. The game will cost users to play, but proceeds from game sales will be donated to different charities that help kids with disabilities.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>Australian Sign Language, or Auslan, was recognised as an official language in 1991. There are about 20,000 native Auslan speakers as of today. As someone who has family members who use Auslan in their day-to-day life, and enjoys playing video games, the idea of being able to learn sign language in an interactive way seems appealing. Technology has become a prominent aspect of our day-to-day lives, being necessary for almost everyone's jobs. As well as this, the world is becoming more and more accessible for people with disabilities, so introducing a game to help people learn and understand sign language would be a big step towards building recognition towards the community.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The basic idea of the project is simple: create a video game designed to teach people sign language while feeling like the user is rewarded for their time and efforts. In order to do this, we first need to discuss what exactly the game entails, such as progression, rewards, and customisations. The content of the game needs to be discussed. The learning-based game requires a significant amount of sign language, as well as the ability for customisation and a reward system. <br><br>

      Initially, the game will load with a menu screen, displaying different options to choose from, such as; which user is playing, How to Play, Shop,  Settings, and Quit. Afterwards, the game will detect whether the computer has camera access available, and ask the user for permissions if it detects one. Otherwise, the game will show a prompt that asks the user to find a camera to use. The player is then taken to their user screen, which displays their character and information. Users will then enter their name, age, gender, and previous sign language experience, ranging from no experience to expert. Then, the user is asked why they are playing the game, which provides multiple choices to select from. These choices will be along the likes of; Want to learn for fun, Heard about it from somewhere, Required to learn sign language, and Other. The user is then taken to a customisation screen, where they can either take a picture of themselves to use on their avatar's face, or select from a series of default options. They can then choose what they are wearing on their avatar character. This gives the user an initial sense of accomplishment, as they have completed the set-up phase of the game.
      <br><br>
      Shortly afterwards, the game has started. The user is shown an introductory sequence, which shows the player how to make their way around the game. Depending on their previous experience, each user will start at a different place, whether it be learning letters and basic words, or figuring out how to speak a complex sentence. If the user has previous experience, they will be asked to sign a few things that they should already know. Once this is completed, users will begin learning about sign language. This process involves watching a short video of an instructor signing, followed by a text description of what the user should be doing, from finger movements to body language. Each stage of the game involves the learning process of different words with similar difficulty, followed by a short quiz, where the user is asked to sign the content they have just learnt. <br><br>

      Once users have passed a stage, they are rewarded with an in-game currency, which is used in the games shop feature. The shop contains customisation items, which is used to personalise the user's in-game avatar. The character can then be seen walking from one stage to another, where players will feel another sense of acomplishment. This process repeats itself until the user has learnt everything they need to know to use sign language in their day-to-day lives. They will be displayed with a 'Thank you for playing this game, and taking the time to learn sign language with us' page. Players are then given the option to learn some additional content, where they can earn additional currency. <br><br>

      Throughout the course of the game, there is an auto-save feature, where user's progress is saved and stored in their user profile page.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      <p>There are a few tools and technologies required to create such a game. To start, a camera would be necessary to play this kind of game. Without the use of a camera, this game would be unplayable. If there are no open-source tools that can be used for motion tracking, this project will also be unplayable without creating your own motion tracking software. Depending on the quality of the project, the user might require a computer that can handle it, such as a minimum RAM requirement, or enough available storage.</p>

    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
      <p>There are many different skills required to complete this project. One of them would be knowing how to create and effectively use motion tracking software if there are no open-source models available. Another skill would be the capability to understand Auslan, as this is what the project idea is based on. Game development skills are also required, with an in-depth understanding of how to create a learning-based video game. <br><br>
      It is very feasible to find people that can create a learning-based video game. With someone who understands and uses Auslan, such as an instructor, a specialist in motion tracking would be able to identify the motions of each signed word.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The outcome of this project idea is a finished, interactive video game in which users learn sign language. Throughout the course of the game, players will have character customisation, and gain rewards for progressing their knowledge. While the project is starting out in Auslan, a future possibility would be to include different recognised sign languages from around the world, increasing accessibility to those who require sign language in their day-to-day lives. Hopefully this game can positively impact some peoples lives and teach a wide range of people sign language.</p>
